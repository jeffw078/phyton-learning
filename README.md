# phyton-learning
During 1 month of study about python basics and concepts i created this files about what i learned, such as, operators, loops, if statement, try except, tuples, lists, dicts and much more.

I started this learning using this video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfscVS0vtbw from freecodecamp and go further using a free course (now in portuguese) by subscribing to a free bunch of courses provided by FIAP https://on.fiap.com.br/local/movimentobrasildigital/
